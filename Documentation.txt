The Following Instructions Should Be Followed While Playing The Hangman game (Running The Program):

1.Enter the perl Hangman.pl command in the terminal .

2.The program will display the welcome message and instructions and the guessed word will display the size of the word you have to guess by displaying “_” as many times as the size of the word.

3.The user then has to enter a single alpha-numeric character. 

4.Now if your guessed letter is present in the word then the guessed words will display that letter at its given position.

5.If you guess it wrong then, it will show a message and display the number of chances left to you.

6.If your guessed character is already guessed whether correctly or incorrectly it asks you to enter another character as this character is already guessed.

7.Keep entering your guess until you win or lose the game.

8.Once the game is over it will ask you whether you want to play it again or not.

9.Press 1 if you want to play again else press any other number to exit from the game.


Points To be Noted:
1.The program will convert your input into lowercase characters if you have entered an Uppercase character as all the letters in the word to be guessed are lowercase and numbers from 0 to 9.

2.Also if you enter more than one character in single input i.e, if you input a string like (a12d) then the program will take only “a” as input.

3.If a letter is present at multiple positions in the word, then it will update it at all the positions.
